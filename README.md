This repo is part of a very simple demo showing how you can use Twilio to solicit suggestions via SMS and have those
messages show up in a browser with any refreshes using Socket.io.  This is an interesting scenario in an event environment 
where you want project what people are suggestion/saying/voting up on a screen. 

TL;DR - Node.js + Socket.io + Twilio = FUN!
